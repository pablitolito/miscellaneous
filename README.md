# Inerpolate_list.py

Based on a list of real numbers where consecutive numbers are equal to or greater than the previous one,
it generates a list where consecutive numbers are always greater than the previous one.
When it finds a group of equal numbers, it modifies their values, generating regular spacing between 
that value and the next greater number.
